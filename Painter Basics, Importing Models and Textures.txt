PBR -
A method of shading and rendering that provide a more accurate representation of how light interacts with surfaces.

Benifits:
1. Easier to create realistic assets
2. Assets will lookaccurate in all lighting conditions
3. Provides a workflow

PBR - Workflows
Metallic/Roughness
Specualar/Glossiness
Height - Excensuate the bumbiness of a matierial

Metallic:
-Base color = diffuse reflected color and metal relectance
	- Known data value
-Metal map acts as a mask to denote raw metal
	- Acts as a mask, tells shader which portion of matieral is metal
-Dielectric (non-metal) F0 (4%) hardcoded in shader
	- Is at 4% because it is the most common matierial in real life.
-Roughness- prevents light reflecting smoothly.

Ask yourself two questions:
Metal or non-metal?
